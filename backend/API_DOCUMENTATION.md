## Authentication System

### Wallet-Based Authentication
The system uses blockchain wallet signatures for authentication:

1. **Get Nonce**: `GET /api/auth/nonce/:address`
2. **Sign Message**: User signs the returned message with their wallet
3. **Login**: `POST /api/auth/login` with address, signature, and message
4. **Use JWT**: Include `Authorization: Bearer <token>` in subsequent requests

### Example Flow:
```bash
# 1. Get nonce
curl http://localhost:3001/api/auth/nonce/0x1234...

# 2. Sign the returned message with wallet
# 3. Login with signature
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "address": "0x1234...",
    "signature": "0xabcd...",
    "message": "Please sign this message..."
  }'

# 4. Use the returned JWT token
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>" \
  http://localhost:3001/api/auth/profile
```
